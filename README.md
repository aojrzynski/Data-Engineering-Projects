# Data Engineering Projects
Welcome to the Data Engineering Projects repository. This repository contains various data data engineering projects implemented using various technologies.

## Project Overview
### Daily Stock Tracker
- **Description:** A data pipeline that connects to the Alpha Vantage API to extract financial data and stores it in a structured format (SQLite database). The pipeline includes cleaning and preprocessing steps.
- **Technologies Used:** Python, pandas, requests, matplotlib, SQLite, python-dotenv, Windows Task Scheduler
- **Practices Used:** API integration, data extraction, data cleaning and preprocessing, data storage and management, data visualization, ETL pipeline development, task automation and scheduling, error handling and logging.

### Data Warehousing Simulation
- **Description:** This project simulates a data engineering workflow using synthetic data. It includes generating data with the Faker library, creating a PostgreSQL database schema, and loading the data into the database. The project also provides an interactive dashboard built with Streamlit to visualize and analyze the data.
- **Technologies Used:** Python, pandas, SQLAlchemy, psycopg2, Faker, PostgreSQL, Streamlit, pgAdmin (optional)
- **Practices Used:** Data modeling and schema design, data extraction and generation, data loading and management, database integration, ETL pipeline development, data visualization, user interaction through a web dashboard, data validation, error handling, project structure organization.
